But if the learning algorithm is too flexible (for instance, too linear), it will fit each training data set differently, and hence have high variance. A key characteristic of many supervised learning methods is a built-in way to control the bias-variance tradeoff either automatically or by providing a special parameter that the data scientist can adjust.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if your target truth is highly nonlinear, and you select a linear model to approximate it, then you’re introducing a bias resulting from the linear model’s inability to capture nonlinearity. In fact, your linear model is underfitting the nonlinear target function over the training set. Likewise, if your target truth is linear, and you select a nonlinear model to approximate it, then you’re introducing a bias resulting from the nonlinear model’s inability to be linear where it needs to be. In fact, the nonlinear model is overfitting the linear target function over the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, we see a plot of the model’s performance using prediction capability on the vertical axis as a function of model complexity on the horizontal axis. Here, we depict the case where we use a number of different orders of polynomial functions to approximate the target function. Shown in the figure are the calculated square bias, variance, and error on the test set for each of the estimator functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that as the model complexity increases, the variance slowly increases and the squared bias decreases. This points to the tradeoff between bias and variance due to model complexity, i.e. models that are too complex tend to have high variance and low bias, while models that are too simple will tend to have high bias and low variance. The best model will have both low bias and low variance. \n",
